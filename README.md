# Ocaml_Or_Haskell
An experiment learning Haskell comparing similar code in Ocaml

## Warning
Hopefully, I will fill this repository later (delayed).

## Description

I started this to learn Haskell from scratch with the help of several books (to be listed.... later).
What appears here includes copied OCAML code from X. Leroy course https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/agenda/cours/structures-de-donnees-persistantes/systemes-de-numeration-et-types-non-reguliers, added tests and testability stuff (printing,...), and translation into Haskell with similar module and function names.

## Plus
If all goes well, I will add some of the notes I made about points I found more difficult.
